## 1. Prerequisites

This document must be followed only if the remote URL of the repository is changed from one website to another

In this case, the repository was originally present at `bitbucket.com` and it was desired to be migrated to `github.com` with all the commits preserved

## 2. Migration Process

#### 2.1 List all the remote URLs

```bash
# The fetch and push URLs
git remote -v
# Both URLs must be the same
```

#### 2.2 Add the `newURL`

```bash
# Add the newURL
git remote set-url --add origin <newURL>
```

#### 2.3 Review URLs

```bash
# The fetch and push URLs
git remote -v
# Both URLs are different now
```

#### 2.4 Delete the `oldURL`

```bash
# This would automatically set the fetch and push URLs to the newURL
git remote set-url --delete origin <oldURL>
```

#### 2.5 Review URLs

```bash
# The fetch and push URLs
git remote -v
# Both URLs are same
```

#### 2.6 Set upstream for each branch separately

```bash
# for master branch
git checkout master
git push -u origin master

# for develop branch
git checkout develop
git push -u origin develop

# Do this for all the other branches
```
#### 2.7 URLs used in this migration

```bash
# oldURL = https://bitbucket.org/usama2519933/lti-medialabs-ui.git
# newURL = https://github.com/LTIMedialab/medialab-ui.git
```
