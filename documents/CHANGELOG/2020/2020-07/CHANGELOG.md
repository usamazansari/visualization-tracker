| `express`       | Core `express` library                            |
| `concurrently`  | Run Angular webapp and express api simultaneously |

2. Modified `scripts` in `package.json`

npm update
npm run build
npm start
```

- Angular web app would run on `http://localhost:4200` and hot reload would be enabled
- Express API would run on `http://localhost:3000/api`
- Any changes in files associated with `http://localhost:3000/api` would require server restart `npm start`
