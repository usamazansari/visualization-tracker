## `develop`, `feature` and `bugfix` branch

**Front End**
1. Web front end for MediaLabs UI is programmed using Angular 10
2. Redux pattern is in use, thanks to `ngRx` library

**Back End**
1. Web back end for MediaLabs UI is programmed using `NodeJS`
2. To handle routes in web back end, `express` is used

## `deploy` branch

**Front End**
1. Remember to build the application
   - Verify if the build is successful and there are no compile time errors

```bash
ng build
```

2. Analyze package sizes
   - This execution uses `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to provide an overview of build packages

```bash
npm run build:stats
npm run analyze

# Open http://localhost:8888/ to view complete analysis of the package sizes in the project
# Optimize wherever required
```

3. Build for production
   - This command would optimize the code, eliminate dead code, enable `aot` compilation and repack everything as `*.html` and `*.js` files

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

**Back End**

*No additional steps for build and analysis*

*The steps would be added when webpack implementation is complete*
